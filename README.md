Re-created a website for one of my favorite boba places in Daly City, CA. My goal for creating this website was to keep the user in mind and have a color scheme that uses their current theme colors. Using Materialize, I incorporated modals and parallax to give the site a better user experience. I also included Google maps view so that the user can map out exactly where the location is. 

Tools Used:

•	Materialize CSS

•	HTML
